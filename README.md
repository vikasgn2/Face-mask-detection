<h1 align="center">Face-Mask-Detection</h1>

<p align="center">
Project using python with various packages while training the model to detect mask.
 </p>
 
### Features
1. Detects mask from live video.
2. Displays realtime text.

### Instructions
1. Install python on your system.
2. Install all the required dependencies and packages listed. 
3. Run `train.py` to train the model.
4. Run `test.py` for live detection.

### How does it work?
* Image classification is used to help create a model.
* This model is trained with a dataset of images of people with and without masks.
* Later the model is used on a test dataset to classify images on the basis of presence of mask.
* The model can be fine tuned to train on larger dataset to improve its detection accuracy.

### Applications
- Automated detection reduces time spent in manual checking in crowded areas.
- Can be further developed into an API which can be used in other applications.
- Reduces risk of human interference since it can be monitored remotely upon improvement.
- Model becomes more accurate and faster as we continue to train it with samples.
